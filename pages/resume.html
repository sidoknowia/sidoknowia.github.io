						<b><i>Performane Analysis and Cost Estimation : </i></b> <br>
						This tool came with the challenge to fetch industrial data using SAP PCo and to maintain it at SAP MII layer. <br>
						I introduced the use of MongoDB for that purpose. <br>
						I was even awarded <i>Technical Excellence</i> award among my group for introducing new concepts to MII and successfully implementing those ideas.
						<br>
					</p>		

					<p class="small">
						<b><i>Industrial Performance : </i></b> <br>
						Introduced AngularJS to develop this application. Designed the module architecture
						for it and also wrote several modules. Result was much faster application, the code is more structured and maintainable.
					</p>					
					<p class="small">
						<b><i>Reference Semantic Model : </i></b> <br>
						I wrote several jQuery based plugins to replace the java based display templates.
						This has decreased the page loading time tremendously. More over we are now also able to provide cross browser
						support (IE8 limited, IE9+ , Safari, Chrome).
					</p>
					<p class="small">
						<b><i>Industrial Maintenance: </i></b> <br>
						Introduced the use of Twitter Bootstrap to support Apple iPad. Moreover the plugins
						that I wrote for RSM were reused that helped us to decrease the page loading time.
					</p>
					<p class="small">
						Development environment for all the applications was SAP MII.
