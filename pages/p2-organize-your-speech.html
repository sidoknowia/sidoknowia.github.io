					<h4>Myths</h4>

					<p>
						Newton's First Law of Motion states that a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion unless an outside force acts on it. However it is often noticed, that outside force to bring about a change is often not enough! It is often seen people, inspite of lot of effort struggle to loose or gain weight.
					</p>
					<p>
						My fellow toastmasters and dear guests a very good morning. Today I want to discuss some of the myths that goes around our world, which might be hindering your progress.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b> Myth #1 : </b> "If I want to loose weight, I'll need to diet." - To that I would say "Stay hungry, stay foolish!".
					</p>
					<p>
						My dear friends if it is your desire to loose weight, you don't have to stay hungry. Infact that will make your journey not only difficult but also quite long!
						Let me explain, human beigns are designed to survive. We can deal with terrible conditions. We can survive in coldest regions of Antartica to hottest regions of Thar. We can adapt.
						So what happens when we start to diet or stay hungry? It triggers a false survival mode! Rather your loosing fat, your body will try to store as much fat as possible and consume it in most optimum way possible. Yes, after few weeks you will loose few kgs but how long are you going to maintain your revolt against food? Someday you'll get a crawing, you'll eat that delicious chocolate cake, and by that time your body would have turned into a fat absorbing sponge!
						That is the reason you might have heard people say, I tried to loose weight, I was making some progress, but it doesnt work. I regained, all that I had lost. Isn't it true.
						So, what you must do is control your matabolism. Rather than decereasing your food content, spread it across through out your day. So rather than having 3 meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have 6 meals per day, but make sure overall quantity of food remains same. This will keep your digistive system active throught the day - which will increase your metabolism and that will increase your fat burning rate!
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Myth #2 : </b>"I want to loose weight - I dont need to lift weights" or 
					</p>
					<p>
						People often avoid lifting weights based on pretext that, it is not required as they want to loose weight. This can work but it will just take much longer time. Let me give you an example suppose you drive a car from point A to point B, in case 1 you drive at top speed reach the destination and turn off the car. In case 2, you drive at a normal speed but after reaching your destination, keep the car turned on for 2 days. In both the cases what do you think, in which scenerio will you burn more fuel? 2nd Case ?? That's what happens when we lift weights. You continouslt burn calories even while you're at rest. For muscles require energy to rebuilt themselves and so you burn more calories.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Myth #3 : </b>"I want to gain weight, I dont need to do any cardiovusculiar exercises".
					</p>
					<p>
						Just as lifting weights is necessary, so is doing cardio! While we are doing cardio, it helps to build a strong respiratory sytem. For each and every task that we do we need energy, and guess what do we do to generate energy continously?? we breathe! More is your abilty to breathe in oxygen, more enegetic you would feel and more active you would be.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Myth #4 : </b>"I'm a girl, if I'll lift weights, I will build muscles!"
					</p>
					<p>
						Very honestly, I always get confused at this statement. Our body is made up of muscles. We are not getting any extra by working out! Without muscle we cannot walk, run, sit or even lift a finger. Muscles are necessary for our survival!
						I assume what the myth means is I might get bulky!
						Girls, look around. Visit any gym and you find a lot of skinny guys lifting more than their body weight and still reach no where! The reason is lifting weights will never ever build a muscle.Infact it will do exactly the opposite. It will break them. How you choose to rebuilt them depends upon your protien intake, your rest period etc - and this is true for evryone. However it will surely help you achieve one thing. It help you achieve a toned look that you might desire!
						<br>
						As the saying goes -- "Lift like a man, look like a Goddess!"

						Over to you toastmaster
